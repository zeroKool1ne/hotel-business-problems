Analysis of hotel business problems, a hypothesis and resulting opportunities

Business problem — High Cancellation Rate

The hotel is experiencing a large number of cancellations, resulting in lost revenue and empty rooms that cannot be resold in time. This instability makes it difficult to forecast demand and plan operations efficiently.

Hypothesis — OTA (online travel agencies) customers cancel more

OTA customers face lower commitment and are more likely to cancel because online platforms make it easy to compare alternatives and rebook elsewhere. Therefore, reservations from OTA market segments are expected to show a higher cancellation rate than direct bookings.
