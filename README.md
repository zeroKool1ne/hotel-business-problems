hotel-business-problems
This project analyzes key problems within the hotel business and explores their underlying drivers. For each identified issue, a clear hypothesis is formulated to explain the observed behavior. Based on these insights, the project highlights resulting business opportunities to improve performance and reduce cancellations.

Business problem — High Cancellation Rate
The hotel is experiencing a large number of cancellations, resulting in lost revenue and empty rooms that cannot be resold in time. This instability makes it difficult to forecast demand and plan operations efficiently.

Hypothesis H1 - Long lead time increases cancellations
Guests who book far in advance have more time to change their plans or find better alternatives, increasing the likelihood of cancellation. Longer lead times also reduce commitment because customers feel less “locked in” compared to last-minute bookings.

Hypothesis H2 — OTA (online travel agencies) customers cancel more
OTA customers face lower commitment and are more likely to cancel because online platforms make it easy to compare alternatives and rebook elsewhere. Therefore, reservations from OTA market segments are expected to show a higher cancellation rate than direct bookings.

Hypothesis H3 - Deposits reduce cancellations
Requiring a deposit introduces financial commitment, making guests less likely to cancel without a strong reason. Even a small upfront payment acts as a psychological anchor that increases booking certainty and discourages impulsive cancellations.
